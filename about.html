			<h1 class="c-provisions__intro">Mission</h1>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">Clean.fit helps people achieve their fitness goals and maintain mind and body wellness while enjoying delicious, all-natural, and convenient snacks and supplements. It's our mission to promote a clean.fit life: the intersection of eating well, staying fit, and practicing self-love.</p>
		</div>
		<!-- test component c-provisions -->
		<div class="c-provisions">
			<h1 class="c-provisions__intro">What’s in a clean.fit box?</h1>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">Each month of your clean.fit box subscription, you'll receive 5-7 premium, hand-curated items: an assortment of non-GMO, clean and delicious fitness snacks plus all-natural, workout enhancing supplements and/or protein powders. Some items are full-size and some are trial size, but the retail value of the box will always exceed your monthly subscription cost!</p>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">Many of the items in the box are high in protein, organic, and grass-fed; but all of the items are produced using only high-quality, simple ingredients that support healthy living.</p>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">We also offer gluten-free and vegetarian clean.fit box options</p>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">Clean-eating and Paleo enthusiasts love our box, as it’s perfectly convenient for the on-the-go lifestyle!</p>

		<div class="c-provisions">
			<h1 class="c-provisions__intro">What’s in a vegetarian clean.fit box?</h1>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">All of the items in the vegetarian clean.fit box meet the same quality standards as our original and gluten-free boxes, of course; but they also meet the requirements of a <a class="c-provisions__anchor" href="#">lacto-ovo vegetarian diet</a>.</p>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">This means the items in the vegetarian clean.fit box could contain egg and dairy ingredients, including vegetarian-friendly whey protein (meaning the enzymes used to cleave the protein are <a class="c-provisions__anchor" href="#">microbial or plant-based</a>; not from animal sources). If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to email <a class="c-provisions__anchor" href="#">info@cleanfitbox.com</a>.</p>

			<h1 class="c-provisions__intro">What’s the history of clean.fit box?</h1>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">clean.fit was started out of a passion for healthy living: eating well, staying fit, and practicing self-love. The founder, Renee Fouquet, was frustrated with the difficulty of finding snack items, protein, and workout supplements that aligned with all three tenets: so many products on the market today focus only on short-term “gains”. That wasn’t good enough - she only wanted to consume products that promote both sustainable long-term fitness and whole body wellness (all while tasting great, of course!).</p>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">clean.fit was born to help like-minded people discover new snack and workout supplement products - which are usually sourced from smaller, independent brands not found in big box stores. All of the items in the box are hand-curated and must meet our high quality standard - never including yucky ingredients!</p>

		<!-- test component c-provisions -->
		<div class="c-provisions">
			<h1 class="c-provisions__intro">When will I receive my clean.fit box?</h1>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">We ship on the 15th day of every month. Orders must be placed by the 15th of the month to receive that month's clean.fit box; otherwise we'll send your box the following month (on the 15th). :)</p>

			<h1 class="c-provisions__intro">What if I need to make changes to or cancel my subscription?</h1>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">You can make updates to your mailing address, account details, or subscription terms (including cancellations) at anytime by logging into your clean.fit box Cratejoy account here:<a class="c-provisions__anchor" href="http://clean-fit-box.cratejoy.com/customer/account">http://clean-fit-box.cratejoy.com/customer/account</a></p>

			<h1 class="c-provisions__intro">What is the ingredient policy?</h1>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">Our partners take pride in their products, using only the finest ingredients.</p>
			<ul class="c-provisions__list">
				<div class="c-provisions__list--group">
					<p class="c-provisions__list--title">We promise our products will <strong>never</strong> include:</p>
					<li class="c-provisions__list--listing">Artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors</li>
					<li class="c-provisions__list--listing">Trans fats or partially-hydrogenated oils</li>
					<li class="c-provisions__list--listing">Fake sweeteners or high-fructose corn syrup</li>
					<p class="c-provisions__list--caption">Basically, no junk: just good, clean.fit foods!</p>

			</ul>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">We do encourage you to check the ingredients on every food item you receive in your clean.fit box to help ensure that you and your loved ones do not have an allergy or sensitivity to a product or its ingredients. While we also try to ensure that the food and drinks that come in clean.fit boxes meet our strict standards, as we do not manufacture the products themselves, we do at times have to rely on the manufacturers assurances that the products meet our standards.</p>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">Again, as a retailer, we do not manufacture, produce, or label the goods that we sell. As such, a product could be mislabeled or otherwise compromised without our knowledge. We cannot be held responsible for the accuracy of ingredients, nutritional information, certifications, manufacturing processes, or any adverse reactions caused by any of the products we sell. We are not responsible for errors or omissions on ingredient lists, nutritional information, or manner/technique of manufacture.</p>
			<p class="c-provisions__copy">Please be aware and safe when it comes to severe allergies or sensitivities. We are not physicians and/or health care practitioners. Any suggestions we make about health claims should be checked with your physician for relevancy to you and your family's health.
